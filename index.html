              An HTML developer is a front-end professional who builds the basic
              structure of websites using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.
              Their main responsibility is to create clean, accessible, and
              well-organized web pages that work smoothly on all devices. They
              use HTML to define the layout, CSS to style the content, and
              JavaScript to add simple interactivity. HTML developers often
              collaborate with designers and backend developers to convert
              designs into functional web pages. They focus on responsive
              design, browser compatibility, and user-friendly interfaces. With
              strong attention to detail, an HTML developer ensures every
              webpage is clear, structured, and visually appealing.
